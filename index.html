			<li><p>When I was a kid my family used to be heavily involed with civil war 
			reenacting. Yes, Like those people you see on some history channel show fake
			shooting each other. All in all it was pretty fun. The kids would get into 
			big groups and pretend shoot each other with fake cap guns so everyone was 
			getting into the spirit. We would go camp and wear clothes from that time period 
			while a bunch of people walked around and looked at us.</p></li>
