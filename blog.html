				<h4>Dan Van Horn -- 10/17/2016</h4>
				<p>This assignment was fairly easy. The main challenge I had is that I dont have any pictures of myself
				on my local machine so I decided to just link my facebook profile picture instead. I was able to accomplish
				it quite easily. I knew how to do most of this assignment already but anything I forgot how or wanted to do 
				extra I looked up on google. I found that the README.md file told me all I needed to know.</p>
